We are seeking bright, motivated and interested scientists to join our group. Opportunities exist for projects on any of our key research areas (or inventive new directions) at MSc, PhD and postdoctoral levels. Macquarie University is highly supportive of higher degree research candidates, and offers competitive scholarships. In addition to external funding opportunities – such as the Australian Research Council’s fellowships scheme – Macquarie University fellowships are available for postdoctoral research. Sydney is an amazing and vibrant city in which to live. If you are interested in joining us – and, importantly, motivated by questions over organisms – then please get in touch!

**Australian Postgraduates Award (APA) Macquarie University (MQRES) scholarships for MSc and PhD research**
