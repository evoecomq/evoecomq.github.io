I am a biologist with 10 years experience in using underutilized insect systems to address fundamental questions in evolution, genetics and ecology. My interests mirror those of the lab, and include sexual competition and conflict, visual signal evolution, host-endosymbiont biology and co-evolution, and in predicting/appraising adaptive evolution. My most significant contributions have arisen in two contexts: (1) the evolution and genetics of colour-based sexual signals (particularly iridescent colours), and (2) the evolutionary/behavioural ecology of contest competition in ‘weaponless’ animals. I've disseminated findings through 50+ refereed scientific papers, multiple invited book chapters, plenary conference presentations, talks and departmental seminars, and via the popular press.
