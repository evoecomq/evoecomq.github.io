We are interested in addressing fundamental questions in evolution, genetics and behaviour. Broadly, our research spans:

- Sexual selection and sexual conflict

- The evolution and design of visual signals

- The evolutionary dynamics of host-endosymbiont interactions

- Adaptive potential in wild populations

We mainly use insects, in part because of their lab tractability, but also in recognition of the astounding chunk of biological diversity that this group represents. A general theme of the lab is to exploit the novel and often exciting empirical opportunities presented by non-model study species. To this end, current projects are underway using species of butterflies, bugs, and spiders; although we also have ongoing projects using conventional model species, such as guppies

Our lab has close links to the [Behavioural Ecology Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/home) at Macquarie University, which is headed by A/Prof. Mariella Herberstein.
